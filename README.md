Create an account to track your daily diet, physical activities, and mental health. This all-in-one health application combines both physical and mental health, allowing users to better track and understand their overall well-being. The journal feature of this application allows users to document their thoughts, daily reflections, or any other messages that they might have. This application was inspired from the need to include mental health aspects into today's most popular fitness apps, where only the physical aspects of health are prioritized.
